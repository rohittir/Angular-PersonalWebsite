# MyWebApplication

This is my personal website created using Angular 4, Bootstrap and Node.js.

There are two data files assets/user-profile and assets/user-timeline that provides all the data to this website. Anyone can replace these files and update with their data to make it their website.

This website also shows the live cricket scores using [cricbuzz](http://www.cricbuzz.com/) API and news using [News API](https://newsapi.org).


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
